a container is a room which includes an appilication and all its dependencies.
a pod is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes that can contain one or more containers.
a pod acts as an abstraction layer, grouping one or more tightly-coupled containers that share a network namespace, IP address, and storage volumes.
this allows the containers within a pod to communicate with each other easily and efficiently.
