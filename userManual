add dockerfile in jetbrains rider

on podman:
Image -> Build 
fill in dockerfile route and folder as well as name
Build the image

Go back to Image
find the last built one
run the code on the image

tips:
after creating the dockerfile in jetbrains rider, move the dockfile to the folder which will be put in 'Build context directory'.
if there's an error while running, it might be due to some legacy issue, the solution is:
add 'V2' in field 'module' in web.config file
